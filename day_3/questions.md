## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

A conditional statement is a two part statement in which the conclusion is based on whether the hypothesis is true or not.

If I finish my homework, I'm going to get pizza for dinner.
If I get pizza, I'm going to the gym in the morning.
If I go to the gym in the morning, I'm having pizza for dinner again.

2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

When you want a program to perform different computations based on the specified inputs.

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

if booleanExpression
    #code to execute if booleanExpression is true
end

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

By using "&&" or "||".

5. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?

if booleanExpression
    #code to execute if booleanExpression is true
elsif booleanExpression2
    #code to execute if booleanExpression2 is true
else
    #code to execute if all previous if and elsif statements are false
end

6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

Maybe the opposite of if, "unless".
